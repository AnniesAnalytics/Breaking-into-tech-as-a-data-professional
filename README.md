# Breaking-into-tech-as-a-data-professional
So, you want to break into tech as a data professional, but you don't want to break the bank? I have collected all of the links, resources, and suggestions I have recieved on my journey of breaking into the field (starting from being a complete beginner!) and I am sharing all of them with you now. 

## What path should I take?
This is a complicated question, with no easy answer. Everyone's situation is different, and I cannot tell you what is going to work for you.
