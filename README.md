# Breaking-into-tech-as-a-data-professional
So, you want to break into tech as a data professional, but you don't want to break the bank? I have collected all of the links, resources, and suggestions I have recieved on my journey of breaking into the field (starting from being a complete beginner!) and I am sharing all of them with you now. 

## What path should I take?
This is a complicated question, with no easy answer. Everyone's situation is different, and I cannot tell you what is going to work for you. 
<br><br>
First, you should make sure that you are actually interested in data- there are many non-coding niches within tech, make sure you pick the one that resonates most with you. 
[Here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurencebradford/2017/03/07/16-tech-careers-you-can-land-no-coding-required/?sh=41ff542926af) are [some articles](https://meratas.com/blog/well-paying-tech-careers-that-dont-involve-coding/) that explore your options.
<br><br>
It is also worth your time to explore the [difference between data science, and data analystics](https://medium.com/@springboard_ind/data-science-vs-data-analytics-how-to-decide-which-one-is-right-for-you-41e7bdec080e). 

## How to get started
As someone who is still fairly new to this, I understand completlely how overwhelming it can be to try and get into this whole "data anlaytics" thing. There are so many options out there. Everyone talks about how you can learn all of these concepts for free online... but that leaves a lot of questions unanswered. Which topics? Where do I find these free resources? Will I be able to get a job without an official degree?
<br> 
I do not have the answers to all of these questions. But- as of writing this I have 14,000 Tik Tok followers. I am in numerous LinkedIn groups. I have been collecting a lot of data points on the advice I have heard everyone giving, and here is what I learned: If you want to break into data analytics, you *must* know how to work with spreadsheets at a high level, learn SQL (sometimes pronounced sequel), and know how to create visualizations (Tableau is the most common way to do this). After reading about 100 job descriptions, you should also probably learn Python- but you should start with spreadsheets and SQL and build up from there. Everything else that I talk about in this guide will be optional, and depending on which direction you go in the field some will be more important than others. 
<br> As for the getting a job without a degree question- I have been over this with hundreds of people at this point. The general consensus is that if you do a good job building your portfolio, have a good resume, and network, you can get a job without a degree. There are many people in the field whose highest "education level" is high school. That being said, obviously having a tech degree would be helpful. Additionally, if you do have a degree in another field, especially one such as a masters degree, it will probably help give you a competitive edge because it shows you have the capacity to learn. Your first job is just that- your first job! You can still break into the industry and build your way up from there.

# Courses- Free and Paid
Coming out of another field to try and break into tech is overwhelming. I am glad that I started with the Google Certificates course in Data Analytics, because it gave me a great foundation for starting out. Before you get started, you need to ask yourself honestly "what are my learning needs?". If you are someone who needs someone else to be giving you deadlines and keeping you on track, then a self-paced course may not be your best option. If you need to be able to talk to professors and work your way through questions, then one of the free/cheaper online courses where you work through a series of modules may not be your best option. If you, like me, are a self-directed learner who prefers to teach yourself and enjoys troubleshooting on your own, then the cheaper/free resources will be a good fit. Of course, your budget is important as well!

## Free Courses
I was surprised to find out how many free courses there are out there. Here is a list of some of the platforms where you can find numerous free courses:

<br>[Elements of AI](https://www.elementsofai.com/) - ok, so this is not a beginner course. Do not start here. But it's free, so it's going in. 

## Paid Courses
I am not going to give you a list of all of the programs and bootcamps out there. There are a TON of options for people who want the structure and support of a degree or bootcamp- but those cost tens of thousands of dollars and you'll have to do your own research if that is your path. This, is a list of the paid courses and platforms which I have come across. They still generally fit the theme of teaching yourself to break into tech. Most are under $100, but a few that seemed interesting or extra to helpful to me have made it onto the list as well. 
**Course platforms**
<br> [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) there are a ton of great courses on Coursera about breaking into tech, and for a lot of them you get a certificate and badge at the end. I was very impressed with the course I took on this platform. The subscription is $50/month. They offer a free trial- which was helpful to me when deciding if I wanted to jump into this or not! As mentioned before, you can apply for financial aid and get a course for free (people comment on my videos often that they applied and got accepted a few weeks later no problem).
<br> [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/new-home/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=brand&utm_content&matchtype=p&device=c&campaignid=6638781067&adgroupid=78995250396&adid=507258932792&gclid=Cj0KCQiA95aRBhCsARIsAC2xvfxSCfjNFqIJnxZBqQgdWL_Rl3OtQSTAQikzAGHj6BHVcOCE5ieAsNMaAjkSEALw_wcB). This is another subscription platform for taking data science courses, specifically. Their subscription is $50/month.
<br> [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) has a ton of different courses on various topics within the data sphere. It seems like the normal price is $300/year for over 350 courses- but I see it is on sale right now for $139
<br> [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/courses/search/?src=ukw&q=data) On the Udemy platform, you can take a lot of interesting courses about breaking into tech within the data analytics sphere. You can choose to pay for a subscription, or buy individual courses. It seems like the subscription to their top courses is $30/month. Individual courses seem to be around $90, but if you get them on sale they can be about $15 and you have lifetime access (not a subscription). I actually bought two of their courses on a sale, and I am saving them for when I am ready.
<br> [LinkedIn learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/subscription/topics?src=go-pa&veh=sem_src.go-pa_c.LLS-C_NAMER_US_T1_EN-US_SEM_SEM_GoogleAds_NA_All_NA_NA_Core_NA_LIL-General-MKAG_Brand_Exact_pkw.linkedinlearning_pmt.e_pcrid.484112882068_pdv.c_plc._trgid.aud-1144395403900:kwd-312799004820_net.g_learning&trk=sem_src.go-pa_c.LLS-C_NAMER_US_T1_EN-US_SEM_SEM_GoogleAds_NA_All_NA_NA_Core_NA_LIL-General-MKAG_Brand_Exact_pkw.linkedinlearning_pmt.e_pcrid.484112882068_pdv.c_plc._trgid.aud-1144395403900:kwd-312799004820_net.g_learning&mcid=6841886150127296674&cname=LLS-C_NAMER_US_T1_EN-US_SEM_SEM_GoogleAds_NA_All_NA_NA_Core_NA_LIL-General-MKAG_Brand_Exact&camid=11768088402&asid=119694082732&targetid=aud-1144395403900:kwd-312799004820&crid=484112882068&placement=&dev=c&ends=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAmpyRBhC-ARIsABs2EArBZwqDU6FvfH6WERemvi6rjUVI97RcG1GThyttsWSe-WojqJgRC7oaAtPbEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)- You can build your skills with various training courses on LinkedIn Learning. The cool thing about this is that these can be easily shared right on your LinkedIn and it can lead to skill badges, I think. I have not done any yet. It looks to me like it is a subscription where the first 30 days are free, then it is $40/month. However, get connected with people on LinkedIn! I see links to take courses for free all the time. 

<br><br> **Courses**
<br> [Learn SQL Course](https://sqlpal.thinkific.com/)- This course is created by the popular TikTokker Kenzie @Sql.pal - this course teaches you all you need to know about SQL $129. On her page she goes over many SQL topics.
<br> [Break Into Tech With Data Analytics](https://breakintotech.teachable.com/p/da-launch?fbclid=IwAR0Q1FwJAeR6KwW9X0D8lIlvFTaFQ1k-uHVnBI7xAL9uwe7yINSXxbCXaHE)- This is the paid version of Charlotte's (@Charlotte_Chz) course about breaking into tech. It is $249 and as a bonus aside from learning data analytics and how to land a job, she has a Discord server with a small group of other people who are taking the course.
