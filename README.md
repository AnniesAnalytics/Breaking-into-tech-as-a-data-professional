# Breaking-into-tech-as-a-data-professional
So, you want to break into tech as a data professional, but you don't want to break the bank? I have collected all of the links, resources, and suggestions I have recieved on my journey of breaking into the field (starting from being a complete beginner!) and I am sharing all of them with you now. 

## What path should I take?
This is a complicated question, with no easy answer. Everyone's situation is different, and I cannot tell you what is going to work for you. 
<br><br>
First, you should make sure that you are actually interested in data- there are many non-coding niches within tech, make sure you pick the one that resonates most with you. 
[Here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurencebradford/2017/03/07/16-tech-careers-you-can-land-no-coding-required/?sh=41ff542926af) are [some articles](https://meratas.com/blog/well-paying-tech-careers-that-dont-involve-coding/) that explore your options.
<br><br>
It is also worth your time to explore the [difference between data science, and data analystics](https://medium.com/@springboard_ind/data-science-vs-data-analytics-how-to-decide-which-one-is-right-for-you-41e7bdec080e). 

## How to get started
As someone who is still fairly new to this, I understand completlely how overwhelming it can be to try and get into this whole "data anlaytics" thing. There are so many options out there. Everyone talks about how you can learn all of these concepts for free online... but that leaves a lot of questions unanswered. Which topics? Where do I find these free resources? Will I be able to get a job without an official degree?
<br> 
I do not have the answers to all of these questions. But- as of writing this I have 14,000 Tik Tok followers. I am in numerous LinkedIn groups. I have been collecting a lot of data points on the advice I have heard everyone giving, and here is what I learned: If you want to break into data analytics, you *must* know how to work with spreadsheets at a high level, learn SQL (sometimes pronounced sequel), and know how to create visualizations (Tableau is the most common way to do this). After reading about 100 job descriptions, you should also probably learn Python- but you should start with spreadsheets and SQL and build up from there. Everything else that I talk about in this guide will be optional, and depending on which direction you go in the field some will be more important than others. 
<br> As for the getting a job without a degree question- I have been over this with hundreds of people at this point. The general consensus is that if you do a good job building your portfolio, have a good resume, and network, you can get a job without a degree. There are many people in the field whose highest "education level" is high school. That being said, obviously having a tech degree would be helpful. Additionally, if you do have a degree in another field, especially one such as a masters degree, it will probably help give you a competitive edge because it shows you have the capacity to learn. Your first job is just that- your first job! You can still break into the industry and build your way up from there.

# Courses- Free and Paid
Coming out of another field to try and break into tech is overwhelming. I am glad that I started with the Google Certificates course in Data Analytics, because it gave me a great foundation for starting out. Before you get started, you need to ask yourself honestly "what are my learning needs?". If you are someone who needs someone else to be giving you deadlines and keeping you on track, then a self-paced course may not be your best option. If you need to be able to talk to professors and work your way through questions, then one of the free/cheaper online courses where you work through a series of modules may not be your best option. If you, like me, are a self-directed learner who prefers to teach yourself and enjoys troubleshooting on your own, then the cheaper/free resources will be a good fit. Of course, your budget is important as well! 
<br><br>
## Free Courses
### Course Platforms
I was surprised to find out how many free courses there are out there. Here is a list of some of the platforms where you can find numerous free courses:
[Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/):
<br>[Free Courses From Harvard](https://discover.edx.org/xgs/cs50?g_acctid=724-505-4034&g_campaign=gs-b2c-nonbrand-us-can-partner-harvard-core&g_campaignid=14747888370&g_adgroupid=131268844967&g_adid=561845958166&g_keyword=harvard%20cs50&g_keywordid=kwd-334019831226&g_network=g&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=gs-b2c-nonbrand-us-can-partner-harvard-core&utm_medium=cpc&utm_term=harvard%20cs50&hsa_acc=7245054034&hsa_cam=14747888370&hsa_grp=131268844967&hsa_ad=561845958166&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-334019831226&hsa_kw=harvard%20cs50&hsa_mt=e&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=Cj0KCQiA95aRBhCsARIsAC2xvfyqS0y_bBoX4krUzdBh8WIXwz2rMccMG8jsrwhUwgBsid6Jl0UZvIUaAgD_EALw_wcB):
<br>[EdX](https://www.edx.org/search?q=SQL):
<br>[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing):
<br>[Coursera](https://www.edx.org/search?q=SQL): Coursera is not free, but if you apply for financial aid, give a good reason, and wait a few weeks, you can get it free.
<br><br>
### Free Courses
<br>EdX [excel courses](https://www.edx.org/learn/excel):
<br>[AP Statistics](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/get-ready-for-ap-statistics) from Khan Academy:

<br>[SQL for  Datascience](https://www.edx.org/course/sql-for-data-science?index=product&queryID=66c46048231a4f800d043b854ad2b100&position=2): with EdX

She has over 100k followers and talks openly about how she job hopped from $28k to over $150 in 5 years, and what it's like to be a data analyst. She has a free and paid version, this one is the free version. 
<br><br> [Elements of AI](https://www.elementsofai.com/):  ok, so this is not a beginner course. Do not start here. But it's free, so it's going in. 

### Tutorials
There are probably thousands of tutorials on the internet (for free). I have not looked at all of them. However, these few were suggested to me by people who tried and liked them, and they seem like they would be helpful for beginners. If you watch one, remember to give their video a like! Will take you a millisecond- but you actually contribute to their popularity and help them get paid by engaging positively like that. It is a little gift I try to give to every creator whose content I enjoy. 
<br>[Learn SQL for beginners - Complete course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxr0s7RmJcs): The title pretty much says it all. Might be a good one to pan through if maybe you want to get a peek into SQL and then decide if you want to jump in more? It is by user Kudvenkat
<br> [SQL Tutorial- Full database course for beginners](https://youtu.be/HXV3zeQKqGY): 
<br> [Python for Everyone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DvywoWv6fI): Chuck Severance 
<br> [Alex the Analyst](https://www.youtube.com/c/AlexTheAnalyst/playlists) has a lot of tutorials on his page about getting into data. 

## Paid Courses
I am not going to give you a list of all of the programs and bootcamps out there. There are a TON of options for people who want the structure and support of a degree or bootcamp- but those cost tens of thousands of dollars and you'll have to do your own research if that is your path. This, is a list of the paid courses and platforms which I have come across. They still generally fit the theme of teaching yourself to break into tech. Most are under $100, but a few that seemed interesting or extra to helpful to me have made it onto the list as well. 
### Course platforms
<br> [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/): there are a ton of great courses on Coursera about breaking into tech, and for a lot of them you get a certificate and badge at the end. I was very impressed with the course I took on this platform. The subscription is $50/month. They offer a free trial- which was helpful to me when deciding if I wanted to jump into this or not! As mentioned before, you can apply for financial aid and get a course for free (people comment on my videos often that they applied and got accepted a few weeks later no problem).
<br> [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/new-home/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=brand&utm_content&matchtype=p&device=c&campaignid=6638781067&adgroupid=78995250396&adid=507258932792&gclid=Cj0KCQiA95aRBhCsARIsAC2xvfxSCfjNFqIJnxZBqQgdWL_Rl3OtQSTAQikzAGHj6BHVcOCE5ieAsNMaAjkSEALw_wcB): This is another subscription platform for taking data science courses, specifically. Their subscription is $50/month.
<br> [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/): has a ton of different courses on various topics within the data sphere. It seems like the normal price is $300/year for over 350 courses- but I see it is on sale right now for $139
<br> [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/courses/search/?src=ukw&q=data): On the Udemy platform, you can take a lot of interesting courses about breaking into tech within the data analytics sphere. You can choose to pay for a subscription, or buy individual courses. It seems like the subscription to their top courses is $30/month. Individual courses seem to be around $90, but if you get them on sale they can be about $15 and you have lifetime access (not a subscription). I actually bought two of their courses on a sale, and I am saving them for when I am ready.
<br> [LinkedIn learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/subscription/topics?src=go-pa&veh=sem_src.go-pa_c.LLS-C_NAMER_US_T1_EN-US_SEM_SEM_GoogleAds_NA_All_NA_NA_Core_NA_LIL-General-MKAG_Brand_Exact_pkw.linkedinlearning_pmt.e_pcrid.484112882068_pdv.c_plc._trgid.aud-1144395403900:kwd-312799004820_net.g_learning&trk=sem_src.go-pa_c.LLS-C_NAMER_US_T1_EN-US_SEM_SEM_GoogleAds_NA_All_NA_NA_Core_NA_LIL-General-MKAG_Brand_Exact_pkw.linkedinlearning_pmt.e_pcrid.484112882068_pdv.c_plc._trgid.aud-1144395403900:kwd-312799004820_net.g_learning&mcid=6841886150127296674&cname=LLS-C_NAMER_US_T1_EN-US_SEM_SEM_GoogleAds_NA_All_NA_NA_Core_NA_LIL-General-MKAG_Brand_Exact&camid=11768088402&asid=119694082732&targetid=aud-1144395403900:kwd-312799004820&crid=484112882068&placement=&dev=c&ends=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAmpyRBhC-ARIsABs2EArBZwqDU6FvfH6WERemvi6rjUVI97RcG1GThyttsWSe-WojqJgRC7oaAtPbEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds): You can build your skills with various training courses on LinkedIn Learning. The cool thing about this is that these can be easily shared right on your LinkedIn and it can lead to skill badges, I think. I have not done any yet. It looks to me like it is a subscription where the first 30 days are free, then it is $40/month. However, get connected with people on LinkedIn! I see links to take courses for free all the time. 
<br> [Cloud Skills Boost With Google](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/): This is a series of courses you can take for cloud skills specifically. Probably not the best place to start as a beginner, but good to know about. The first 30 days are free. 

<br><br> **Courses**
<br> [Google Data Analytics Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics?utm_source=google&utm_medium=institutions&utm_campaign=gwgsite&_ga=2.220124505.1774160224.1646759344-632836386.1643306114): This course is what I started with- it started this entire journey of breaking into tech for me. The first 7 days are free. I could have sworn I only paid $40/ month after that but when I looked at a Coursera subscription last night it said $50/month. Either way- this is a self paced course. It took me a month + a few of those 7 free days from the trial, so I only paid for one month. I absolutley loved this course- I thought it was a great introduction to the basics. It did not cover Python, is the only drawback. I feel like it gave me such good foundational knowledge on spreadsheets, SQL, Tableau, and R- and in addition, some concepts that are important to know as a data analyst, such as presentation skills. The course is designed so well- a great balance of readings, videos, and hands on learning activities and quizzes. When you finish you get a badge for LinkedIn, and access to a jobs platform. These jobs seem to be very basic- like mostly using spreadsheets and maybe some SQL. You also get connected with a huge community of people who also took this course.
<br> [Data With Danny](https://www.datawithdanny.com/): This is like a hybrid course/apprenticeship- "Learn Data Analytics, Data Science & Machine Learning under guided mentorship and deliver challenging projects in a unique data apprenticeship". I don't know much about it, but it might be that hands on chat with your instructor type thing people are looking for. It is $50, but there is also a $20 student discount.
<br> [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/): This is a Udemy course I have had reccomended to me multiple times! Since I took the Google DA course, it did not cover Python. So I was looking for another course on Python. I actually bought this (impulse buy) because it was on sale for $15 last night. That's like one drink at a fancy bar. So I'll let you know when I take it what I think! Normally it's like $90.
<br>[Microsoft Certified: Data Analyst Associate with Power BI](https://www.udemy.com/course/exam-da-100-a-complete-guide-on-acing-the-exam-with-powerbi/learn/lecture/19899638?start=0#overview): I have heard a lot about power BI, so I also impusle bought this one for like $12 last night. I am interested in the fact that it says that you get a certificate that you can put on your LinkedIn when it is finished. I do not actually know what Power BI is yet... but it seems like something that is gaining popularity in the analytics space and could really help to know. 
<br>[2022 Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/): This seems like a more all encompassing option that the other Udemy courses: "Learn Python like a Professional Start from the basics and go all the way to creating your own applications and games". It is $140, or $25 on sale. 
<br>[Python for Web Apps and Data](https://skillcrush.com/blueprint/python-web-apps-data-course/): This strikes me as a good course for someone who wants to learn Python, and already knows SQL and stuff- and knows which areas of data they are looking to get into and really want to be job ready by the end. It is $550
<br>[Professional Certificate in Data Analyst](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/ibm-data-analyst?index=product&queryID=dbf58cc7138ff2d187a974935760cc09&position=1): Ok, so this course is pretty expensive for this list. But, it seems like it is not only very comprehensive, but it is also an IBM course and I feel like it would look really great on a resume. This strikes me as more like a Bootcamp- like I feel like by the end of this you should be job ready for an entry level job. 
<br>[Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python): This course by the U of Michigan has been suggested to me numerous times for learning Python. It is on Coursera- so that $50/mo subscription will cover the whole course.
<br> [Learn SQL Course](https://sqlpal.thinkific.com/)- This course is created by the popular TikTokker Kenzie @Sql.pal - this course teaches you all you need to know about SQL $129. On her page she goes over many SQL topics.
<br> [Break Into Tech With Data Analytics](https://breakintotech.teachable.com/p/da-launch?fbclid=IwAR0Q1FwJAeR6KwW9X0D8lIlvFTaFQ1k-uHVnBI7xAL9uwe7yINSXxbCXaHE): This is the paid version of Charlotte's (@Charlotte_Chz) course about breaking into tech. It is $249 and as a bonus aside from learning data analytics and how to land a job, she has a Discord server with a small group of other people who are taking the course. 

# Up Next
The rest of what I have to share in here is for those of us who are taking a "do it myself" approach. These are all of the links that I have been directed to in my courses, by other people, or found myself that I think are worth sharing. 

# Spreadsheets
Spreadsheets seem to me to be the foundation of working with data. So imagine a big old START HERE sign on this section.
