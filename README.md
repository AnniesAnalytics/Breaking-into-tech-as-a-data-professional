# Breaking-into-tech-as-a-data-professional
So, you want to break into tech as a data professional, but you don't want to break the bank? I have collected all of the links, resources, and suggestions I have received on my journey of breaking into the field (starting from being a complete beginner!) and I am sharing all of them with you now. 

## What path should I take?
This is a complicated question, with no easy answer. Everyone's situation is different, and I cannot tell you what is going to work for you. 
<br><br>
First, you should make sure that you are actually interested in data- there are many non-coding niches within tech, make sure you pick the one that resonates most with you. 
[Here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurencebradford/2017/03/07/16-tech-careers-you-can-land-no-coding-required/?sh=41ff542926af) are [some articles](https://meratas.com/blog/well-paying-tech-careers-that-dont-involve-coding/) that explore your options.
<br><br>
It is also worth your time to explore the [difference between data science, and data analytics](https://medium.com/@springboard_ind/data-science-vs-data-analytics-how-to-decide-which-one-is-right-for-you-41e7bdec080e). 

## How to get started
As someone who is still fairly new to this, I understand completely how overwhelming it can be to try and get into this whole "data analytics" thing. There are so many options out there. Everyone talks about how you can learn all of these concepts for free online... but that leaves a lot of questions unanswered. Which topics? Where do I find these free resources? Will I be able to get a job without an official degree?
<br> <br>
I do not have the answers to all of these questions. But- as of writing this I have 14,000 Tik Tok followers. I am in numerous LinkedIn groups. I have been collecting a lot of data points on the advice I have heard everyone giving, and here is what I learned: If you want to break into data analytics, you *must* know how to work with spreadsheets at a high level, learn SQL (sometimes pronounced sequel), and know how to create visualizations (Tableau is the most common way to do this). After reading about 100 job descriptions, you should also probably learn Python- but you should start with spreadsheets and SQL and build up from there. Everything else that I talk about in this guide will be optional, and depending on which direction you go in the field some will be more important than others. 
<br><br> As for the getting a job without a degree question- I have been over this with hundreds of people at this point. The general consensus is that if you do a good job building your portfolio, have a good resume, and network, you can get a job without a degree. There are many people in the field whose highest "education level" is high school. That being said, obviously having a tech degree would be helpful. Additionally, if you do have a degree in another field, especially one such as a masters degree, it will probably help give you a competitive edge because it shows you have the capacity to learn. Your first job is just that- your first job! You can still break into the industry and build your way up from there.
<br><br> In addition, I would like to let you know that if you are just starting out on this journey of switching careers and jumping into data analytics/science and feeling overwhelmed- you are not alone! There are a lot of us in the same position right now. Please feel free to join the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/CwCda5ruN6) I have created. I had never heard of  Discord before a few months ago- so do not worry if you haven't. It is basically just another type of social media- but you get into communities focused around one subject. In our Discord (I moderate it with several others who are actually data pros) we have multiple channels on all sorts of different topics. You could ask a question about pretty much any corner of data analytics and have your question answered by someone who is actually in the field within a few days! It is an amazing resource and community, and I am so glad my followers asked me to make it!

# Courses- Free and Paid :ok_hand:
Coming out of another field to try and break into tech is overwhelming. I am glad that I started with the Google Certificates course in Data Analytics, because it gave me a great foundation for starting out. Before you get started, you need to ask yourself honestly "what are my learning needs?". If you are someone who needs someone else to be giving you deadlines and keeping you on track, then a self-paced course may not be your best option. If you need to be able to talk to professors and work your way through questions, then one of the free/cheaper online courses where you work through a series of modules may not be your best option. If you, like me, are a self-directed learner who prefers to teach yourself and enjoys troubleshooting on your own, then the cheaper/free resources will be a good fit. Of course, your budget is important as well! 
## Free Courses :heart_eyes:
### Course Platforms
I was surprised to find out how many free courses there are out there. Here is a list of some of the platforms where you can find numerous free courses: <br><br>
[Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/): Their homepage has an impressive intro: "Learn to code — for free.

If you are from a minority group, live in a few key regions, and meet the other requirements, you can apply for this free bootcamp that will help you break into tech- learn the skills you need (technical and interpersonal)- to land a new job.
<br>
### Free Courses :free:
<br>EdX [excel courses](https://www.edx.org/learn/excel): Do you want to learn Excel, especially because I am saying it is definitely the most foundational skill and the one you should start with? They've got you. 
<br>[AP Statistics](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/get-ready-for-ap-statistics) from Khan Academy: I personally have not encountered a need for math so far on my journey to get into data analytics but people have told me that they took Khan Academy math courses and it was helpful? I think they might be in a related niche like computer science or software engineering or something but I do not know.
<br>[Welcome to SQL](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql/sql-basics/v/welcome-to-sql) with Khan Academy:

She has over 100k followers and talks openly about how she job hopped from $28k to over $150 in 5 years, and what it's like to be a data analyst. She has a free and paid version, this one is the free version. 
<br> [This Twitter user](https://twitter.com/PythonWithRune/status/1504533216211910657?s=20&t=8JGndziqNpXuDPzibcrqlQ) made a post about free courses for breaking into data science.
<br><br> [Elements of AI](https://www.elementsofai.com/):  ok, so this is not a beginner course. Do not start here. But it's free, so it's going in. 


### Tutorials
There are probably thousands of tutorials on the internet (for free). I have not looked at all of them. However, these few were suggested to me by people who tried and liked them, and they seem like they would be helpful for beginners. If you watch one, remember to give their video a like! Will take you a millisecond- but you actually contribute to their popularity and help them get paid by engaging positively like that. It is a little gift I try to give to every creator whose content I enjoy. 
<br>[Learn SQL for beginners - Complete course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxr0s7RmJcs): The title pretty much says it all. Might be a good one to pan through if maybe you want to get a peek into SQL and then decide if you want to jump in more? It is by user Kudvenkat
<br> [SQL Tutorial- Full database course for beginners](https://youtu.be/HXV3zeQKqGY): 
<br> [Python for Everyone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DvywoWv6fI): Chuck Severance 
<br> [Alex the Analyst](https://www.youtube.com/c/AlexTheAnalyst/playlists) has a lot of tutorials on his page about getting into data. 

## Paid Courses
I am not going to give you a list of all of the programs and bootcamps out there. There are a TON of options for people who want the structure and support of a degree or bootcamp- but those cost tens of thousands of dollars and you'll have to do your own research if that is your path. This, is a list of the paid courses and platforms which I have come across. They still generally fit the theme of teaching yourself to break into tech. Most are under $100, but a few that seemed interesting or extra to helpful to me have made it onto the list as well. 
### Course platforms
[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/): there are a ton of great courses on Coursera about breaking into tech, and for a lot of them you get a certificate and badge at the end. I was very impressed with the course I took on this platform. The subscription is $50/month. They offer a free trial- which was helpful to me when deciding if I wanted to jump into this or not! As mentioned before, you can apply for financial aid and get a course for free (people comment on my videos often that they applied and got accepted a few weeks later no problem).
<br> [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/new-home/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=brand&utm_content&matchtype=p&device=c&campaignid=6638781067&adgroupid=78995250396&adid=507258932792&gclid=Cj0KCQiA95aRBhCsARIsAC2xvfxSCfjNFqIJnxZBqQgdWL_Rl3OtQSTAQikzAGHj6BHVcOCE5ieAsNMaAjkSEALw_wcB): This is another subscription platform for taking data science courses, specifically. Their subscription is $50/month.
<br> [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/): has a ton of different courses on various topics within the data sphere. It seems like the normal price is $300/year for over 350 courses- but I see it is on sale right now for $139
<br> [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/courses/search/?src=ukw&q=data): On the Udemy platform, you can take a lot of interesting courses about breaking into tech within the data analytics sphere. You can choose to pay for a subscription, or buy individual courses. It seems like the subscription to their top courses is $30/month. Individual courses seem to be around $90, but if you get them on sale they can be about $15 and you have lifetime access (not a subscription). I actually bought two of their courses on a sale, and I am saving them for when I am ready.
<br> [LinkedIn learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/subscription/topics?src=go-pa&veh=sem_src.go-pa_c.LLS-C_NAMER_US_T1_EN-US_SEM_SEM_GoogleAds_NA_All_NA_NA_Core_NA_LIL-General-MKAG_Brand_Exact_pkw.linkedinlearning_pmt.e_pcrid.484112882068_pdv.c_plc._trgid.aud-1144395403900:kwd-312799004820_net.g_learning&trk=sem_src.go-pa_c.LLS-C_NAMER_US_T1_EN-US_SEM_SEM_GoogleAds_NA_All_NA_NA_Core_NA_LIL-General-MKAG_Brand_Exact_pkw.linkedinlearning_pmt.e_pcrid.484112882068_pdv.c_plc._trgid.aud-1144395403900:kwd-312799004820_net.g_learning&mcid=6841886150127296674&cname=LLS-C_NAMER_US_T1_EN-US_SEM_SEM_GoogleAds_NA_All_NA_NA_Core_NA_LIL-General-MKAG_Brand_Exact&camid=11768088402&asid=119694082732&targetid=aud-1144395403900:kwd-312799004820&crid=484112882068&placement=&dev=c&ends=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAmpyRBhC-ARIsABs2EArBZwqDU6FvfH6WERemvi6rjUVI97RcG1GThyttsWSe-WojqJgRC7oaAtPbEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds): You can build your skills with various training courses on LinkedIn Learning. The cool thing about this is that these can be easily shared right on your LinkedIn and it can lead to skill badges, I think. I have not done any yet. It looks to me like it is a subscription where the first 30 days are free, then it is $40/month. However, get connected with people on LinkedIn! I see links to take courses for free all the time. 
<br> [Cloud Skills Boost With Google](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/): This is a series of courses you can take for cloud skills specifically. Probably not the best place to start as a beginner, but good to know about. The first 30 days are free. 

<br><br> **Courses**
<br> [Google Data Analytics Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics?utm_source=google&utm_medium=institutions&utm_campaign=gwgsite&_ga=2.220124505.1774160224.1646759344-632836386.1643306114): This course is what I started with- it started this entire journey of breaking into tech for me. The first 7 days are free. I could have sworn I only paid $40/ month after that but when I looked at a Coursera subscription last night it said $50/month. Either way- this is a self paced course. It took me a month + a few of those 7 free days from the trial, so I only paid for one month. I absolutely loved this course- I thought it was a great introduction to the basics. It did not cover Python, is the only drawback. I feel like it gave me such good foundational knowledge on spreadsheets, SQL, Tableau, and R- and in addition, some concepts that are important to know as a data analyst, such as presentation skills. The course is designed so well- a great balance of readings, videos, and hands on learning activities and quizzes. When you finish you get a badge for LinkedIn, and access to a jobs platform. These jobs seem to be very basic- like mostly using spreadsheets and maybe some SQL. You also get connected with a huge community of people who also took this course.
<br> [Data With Danny](https://www.datawithdanny.com/): This is like a hybrid course/apprenticeship- "Learn Data Analytics, Data Science & Machine Learning under guided mentorship and deliver challenging projects in a unique data apprenticeship". I don't know much about it, but it might be that hands on chat with your instructor type thing people are looking for. It is $50, but there is also a $20 student discount.
<br> [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/): This is a Udemy course I have had recomended to me multiple times! Since I took the Google DA course, it did not cover Python. So I was looking for another course on Python. I actually bought this (impulse buy) because it was on sale for $15 last night. That's like one drink at a fancy bar. So I'll let you know when I take it what I think! Normally it's like $90.
<br>[Microsoft Certified: Data Analyst Associate with Power BI](https://www.udemy.com/course/exam-da-100-a-complete-guide-on-acing-the-exam-with-powerbi/learn/lecture/19899638?start=0#overview): I have heard a lot about power BI, so I also impulse bought this one for like $12 last night. I am interested in the fact that it says that you get a certificate that you can put on your LinkedIn when it is finished. I do not actually know what Power BI is yet... but it seems like something that is gaining popularity in the analytics space and could really help to know. 
<br>[2022 Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/): This seems like a more all encompassing option that the other Udemy courses: "Learn Python like a Professional Start from the basics and go all the way to creating your own applications and games". It is $140, or $25 on sale. 
<br>[Python for Web Apps and Data](https://skillcrush.com/blueprint/python-web-apps-data-course/): This strikes me as a good course for someone who wants to learn Python, and already knows SQL and stuff- and knows which areas of data they are looking to get into and really want to be job ready by the end. It is $550
<br>[Professional Certificate in Data Analyst](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/ibm-data-analyst?index=product&queryID=dbf58cc7138ff2d187a974935760cc09&position=1): Ok, so this course is pretty expensive for this list. But, it seems like it is not only very comprehensive, but it is also an IBM course and I feel like it would look really great on a resume. This strikes me as more like a Bootcamp- like I feel like by the end of this you should be job ready for an entry level job. 
<br>[Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python): This course by the U of Michigan has been suggested to me numerous times for learning Python. It is on Coursera- so that $50/mo subscription will cover the whole course.
<br> [Learn SQL Course](https://sqlpal.thinkific.com/)- This course is created by the popular TikTokker Kenzie @Sql.pal - this course teaches you all you need to know about SQL $129. On her page she goes over many SQL topics.
<br> [Break Into Tech With Data Analytics](https://breakintotech.teachable.com/p/da-launch?fbclid=IwAR0Q1FwJAeR6KwW9X0D8lIlvFTaFQ1k-uHVnBI7xAL9uwe7yINSXxbCXaHE): This is the paid version of Charlotte's (@Charlotte_Chz) course about breaking into tech. It is $249 and as a bonus aside from learning data analytics and how to land a job, she has a Discord server with a small group of other people who are taking the course.

The rest of what I have to share in here is for those of us who are taking a "do it myself" approach. These are all of the links that I have been directed to in my courses, by other people, or found myself that I think are worth sharing. 

# Spreadsheets :floppy_disk:
Spreadsheets seem to me to be the foundation of working with data. So imagine a big old START HERE sign on this section.

## Spreadsheet Cheat Sheets
Who *doesn't* love a good cheat sheet? I found quite a few:
* [Google sheets cheat sheet ](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9300022)
* [Excel keyboard shortcuts ](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/keyboard-shortcuts-in-excel-1798d9d5-842a-42b8-9c99-9b7213f0040f)

## Files for Further Reading
There is some readings that I have found to be so useful, that I saved the entire thing. However, it would be impractical to just paste all of that information into here, and I cannot add a file for you to download. So my workaround is I have added a page on my website where I can have files which you can download. I am going to add each of the following information filled files there, and so just [click this link](https://anniesanalytics.wixsite.com/annie-nelson/general-9) to go to the page where I am going to link to all of the following files. 
<br> Go to where I have labeled "#1- Spreadsheets Files" to find these files.
* How to use VLOOKUP in Sheets/Excel
* Data cleaning functions in spreadsheets
* How to access your changelog of your spreadsheet
* Keyboard Shortcuts in Sheets cheatsheet
* Using Pivot Tables 
* Common Errors in Spreadsheets and How to Fix Them
* SQL Functions learned in the Google Course (With examples)

### Problem Solving
It is so frustrating to come up with an error in your sheet, especially when you are trying to teach yourself this stuff and there is nobody to help you. There are actually people out there to help you on the internet! But in the meantime, this may help you problem solve:

* [How to correct a #Value! error](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/how-to-correct-a-value-error-15e1b616-fbf2-4147-9c0b-0a11a20e409e) 

### Charts and Graphs
Here are some links about information on how to make and format charts in spreadhsheets:
[Graphs in Google Sheets](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/graphs-in-spreadsheets): Not only does this resource contain a detailed example of chart creation in spreadsheets, but it also provides you with downloadable sample data you can use to practice. As you have learned throughout this course, practicing these skills helps you learn more about the tools you are using. This example data is a great way to start!
<br><br>[Add and edit a chart or graph in Google Sheets](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/63824): This article includes steps for creating, editing, and changing charts in Google Sheets with how-to videos. It also has a more in-depth guide to editing and customizing your chart after you have created it.  
<br><br>[Create a Microsoft Excel chart from start to finish](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-chart-from-start-to-finish-0baf399e-dd61-4e18-8a73-b3fd5d5680c2): This how-to guide from Microsoft’s support site includes instructions and a video tutorial for adding charts to Excel spreadsheets. This is a useful resource if you are working specifically with Excel spreadsheets. It also links to other useful articles about creating charts in Excel. 
<br><br>[Microsoft Excel: Creating and modifying charts](https://guides.lib.umich.edu/c.php?g=283162&p=1886446): This is an explanation of Excel charts with downloadable handouts. This resource is especially useful because it has downloadable content that you can save to reference later when you start creating charts in your own spreadsheets.

### Specific Functions
You may need some more information on how to do these somewhat more complicated functions:
* [Import range (brings in values from another sheet)](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093340?hl=en&ref_topic=9199554)
* [Sort data or range in tables excel ](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/sort-data-in-a-range-or-table-62d0b95d-2a90-4610-a6ae-2e545c4a4654)

* [Import a table from a Webpage](https://martechwithme.com/how-to-import-data-from-website-to-google-sheets/)

<br><br>SUMIFS and COUNTIFS are just two examples of functions with multiple conditions. They help demonstrate how multiple conditions can be built into the basic syntax of a function. But, there are other functions with multiple conditions that you can use in your data analysis. There are a lot of resources available online to help you get started with these other functions:
* [How to use the Excel IFS function](https://exceljet.net/excel-functions/excel-ifs-function): This resource includes an explanation and example of the IFS function in Excel. This is a great reference if you are interested in learning more about IFS. The example is a useful way to understand this function and how it can be used. 
* [VLOOKUP in Excel with multiple criteria](https://exceljet.net/formula/vlookup-with-multiple-criteria): Similar to the previous resource, this resource goes into more detail about how to use VLOOKUP with multiple criteria. Being able to apply VLOOKUP with multiple criteria will be a useful skill, so check out this resource for more guidance on how you can start using it on your own spreadsheet data.  
* [INDEX and MATCH in Excel with multiple criteria](https://exceljet.net/formula/index-and-match-with-multiple-criteria): This resource explains how to use the INDEX and MATCH functions with multiple criteria. It also includes an example which helps demonstrate how these functions work with multiple criteria and actual data. 
* [Using IF with AND, OR, and NOT functions in Excel](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/using-if-with-and-or-and-not-functions-d895f58c-b36c-419e-b1f2-5c193a236d97): This resource combines IF with AND, OR, and NOT functions to create more complex functions. By combining these functions, you can perform your tasks more efficiently and cover more criteria at once. 


### More Functions in Excel
I will be honest with you, I copy and pasted the following right from my course I took: <br>
<br>[Keyboard shortcuts in Excel](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/keyboard-shortcuts-in-excel-1798d9d5-842a-42b8-9c99-9b7213f0040f?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US): Earlier in this list, you were provided with a resource for keyboard shortcuts in Google Sheets.

# Boolean Operators
If you have never heard of [Boolean Operators](https://libguides.mit.edu/c.php?g=175963&p=1158594), I guess you might think about skipping over this section. But! You actually should know about Boolean Operators and what each of them mean if you want to work with data. It is not a hard concept to understand, once it is explained to you. 

# SQL :mag_right:
SQL is, as I perceive it, the next most widely needed *thing* when working with data. Without any further ado, here is the free information I have to share:

# Problem Solving 
This goes for SQL and all other things within the data analytics space:
<br>Can’t get your code to work? Wondering “if….”? [Try Stack OverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com/). *The* spot for problem solving.  


# Tableau/Data Visualization :chart_with_upwards_trend:
It feels like it is totally switching gears when you suddenly start talking about visualizations. It really threw me off to go from "Ok, so the comma has to go HERE" to "What colors should I make the bars in this chart?". 
<br> So far, I only have a couple of text files/decision trees that I think are really helpful and want to share with you about data visualizations/Tableau. [Click here](https://anniesanalytics.wixsite.com/annie-nelson/general-9) to go to my website where you can download these files (for free, of course, no weird software downloads or anything, I just can't add them to my page here easily). Scroll to "#3- Visualization Files"

## Tableau Basics
[This video](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/resources) is a great starting place. It is divided into sections so you can skip to what you need if you want.

## How to Create Different Charts
I am not going to lie, every time I use Tableau so far, it is a lot of me just clicking buttons and moving things around, hoping it will do what I want. Be smarter than me. Read these resources. They're free.
* Highlight tables appear like tables with conditional formatting. [Review the steps](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/buildexamples_highlight.htm) to build a highlight table. 
* [Heat maps](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/buildexamples_highlight.htm) show intensity or concentrations in the data.
* [Density maps](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/maps_howto_heatmap.htm) show concentrations (like a population density map). 
* [Gantt charts](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/buildexamples_gantt.htm) show the duration of events or activities on a timeline. 
* [Symbol maps](https://interworks.com/blog/ccapitula/2014/08/18/tableau-essentials-chart-types-symbol-map/) display a mark over a given longitude and latitude. Learn more from this example of a symbol map.
* Filled maps are maps with areas colored based on a measurement or dimension. [Explore an example](https://interworks.com/blog/ccapitula/2014/09/23/tableau-essentials-chart-types-filled-map/) of a filled map.
* Circle views show comparative strength in data. [Learn more from this example](https://interworks.com/blog/ccapitula/2014/10/17/tableau-essentials-chart-types-circle-view/) of a circle view.
* [Box plots](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/buildexamples_boxplot.htm) also known as box-and whiskers charts show the distribution of values along a chart axis. 
* [Bullet graphs](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/qs_bullet_graphs.htm) compare a primary measure with another and can be used instead of dial gauge charts. 
* [Packed bubble charts](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/buildexamples_bubbles.htm) display data in clustered circles.

# Internet Resources for Learning More about Data and Being a Data Professional :computer:
## Social Media :iphone:
### Tik Tok Pages
I follow all of these creators. I like their videos, and watch them, and share them- because I know that every creator who is just putting themselves out there on the internet for free to help people deserves engagement from people who enjoy their content :relieved:
<br>@python.chick : Has a lot of content about getting into data science, learning Python, and what it's like to be in the field. She seems brilliant to me. 
<br> @charlotte_chz : Charlotte and I started our pages at a about the same time. I now have 14k followers and she has 128k :sweat_smile:. I really like her content about job hopping up to $158k a year within a few years after teaching herself data analytics- I see her as like that cool older cousin who is a few steps ahead of me in life. We talk sometimes, she knows how I feel about her. I also love that she talks about what is actually like to be a data analyst from day to day, and about hiring related things.
<br> @stocksandsquats: I feel similarly about Hannah as I do to Charlotte. She has very similar content but they are in different areas of data analytics so it is another perspective. Hannah also is not afraid to show her personality and voice her opinions on Tik Tok and I like that about her. She is clearly just trying to make content to help people. 
<br> @sql.pal: Kenzie is another creator in the space of data analytics who are here to help and spread good vibes. She consistently puts out content about using and learning SQL, including an entire series about how to do JOINs. She is a sweet and positive creator, and she even hopped on to help moderate my Discord with me right away when I started out and has contributed some helpful things in different channels. 
<br> @zero2sudo: I just discovered his page recently and I love it. He is in software engineering, so not quite data analytics. However, he gives a lot of good tech tips in general on his page- and he has a whole playlist (free) on learning Python. As soon as I commented on one of his posts trying to chat with him he followed me and messaged me, and has been very friendly and helpful since then. If you have any troubles learning Python or questions in general, or just want to have people in your feed who are not only killing it in tech but also lifting while they climb, go check his page out. 
<br> @lucaswonderley: I only discovered him a day ago, but his bio is "Daily software development content". He seems to have interesting stuff on Python, so if you want to learn that, check him out.
### YouTube 
I have not taken/ watched any of these courses myself so I cannot compare them, but I can say they have been suggested to me by my followers! There are also tons and tons more videos on YouTube that I did not mention here.
[Learn SQL for beginners - complete course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxr0s7RmJcs)
<br> [SQL Tutorial - Full Database Course for Beginners](https://youtu.be/HXV3zeQKqGY)
<br> [python for everyone chuck severance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DvywoWv6fI)
<br>
<br> [Alex the Analyst](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7cs8q-gJRlGwj4A8OmCmXg): If you want to get into Data Analytics, definitely check out his page! He is so knowledgeable and helpful, and he taught himself! I have loved his videos and could not pick just one to suggest. 
#  Books about Working With Data :closed_book:
These are books that have been suggested to me:
* [Storytelling with data](https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/books): This book was suggested to me by someone who said that it was immensely helpful to them in learning how to use Tableau and create professional looking visualizations. It apparently even comes with practice examples where you can work on the skills you are learning. It's $44 new, but I found it for about $25 online used (I did not buy it)
* [Understanding variation- the key to managing chaos](https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Variation-Key-Managing-Chaos/dp/0945320531/ref=asc_df_0945320531/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312243616995&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=10157928750189271098&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9003619&hvtargid=pla-464534775964&psc=1): People on Amazon love this book. One review "This book is well written with great graphics (tables and charts) that illustrate main ideas and examples. It is moderate to difficult subject matter covered in such a way that makes for an easy read with necessary information to know for all decision-making professionals within an organization. The author provides real life examples where companies have analyzed data, completely missing or misinterpreting the clear signals the data was displaying causing the company unnecessary costs. Likewise, the author does a superb job at highlighting why behavior control charts are a mandatory and useful tool when analyzing data used for strategic decision-making. What is a behavior control chart you say? I recommend that you read this book". It is $47 but I found it for $8 used. 
* [Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/): Free! Online. "In Automate the Boring Stuff with Python, you'll learn how to use Python to write programs that do in minutes what would take you hours to do by hand - no prior programming experience required". It is intriguing to me, and since it is free.99 I do think I will check it out at some point! I am interested in this idea of automating. I am definitely the type of person who goes "Ok, but how could I do that better?"
