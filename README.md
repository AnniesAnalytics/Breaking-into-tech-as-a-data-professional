# Breaking-into-tech-as-a-data-professional
So, you want to break into tech as a data professional, but you don't want to break the bank? I have collected all of the links, resources, and suggestions I have recieved on my journey of breaking into the field (starting from being a complete beginner!) and I am sharing all of them with you now. 

## What path should I take?
This is a complicated question, with no easy answer. Everyone's situation is different, and I cannot tell you what is going to work for you. 
<br><br>
First, you should make sure that you are actually interested in data- there are many non-coding niches within tech, make sure you pick the one that resonates most with you. 
[Here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurencebradford/2017/03/07/16-tech-careers-you-can-land-no-coding-required/?sh=41ff542926af) are [some articles](https://meratas.com/blog/well-paying-tech-careers-that-dont-involve-coding/) that explore your options.
<br><br>
It is also worth your time to explore the [difference between data science, and data analystics](https://medium.com/@springboard_ind/data-science-vs-data-analytics-how-to-decide-which-one-is-right-for-you-41e7bdec080e). 

## How to get started
As someone who is still fairly new to this, I understand completlely how overwhelming it can be to try and get into this whole "data anlaytics" thing. There are so many options out there. Everyone talks about how you can learn all of these concepts for free online... but that leaves a lot of questions unanswered. Which topics? Where do I find these free resources? Will I be able to get a job without an official degree?
<br> 
I do not have the answers to all of these questions. But- as of writing this I have 14,000 Tik Tok followers. I am in numerous LinkedIn groups. I have been collecting a lot of data points on the advice I have heard everyone giving, and here is what I learned: If you want to break into data analytics, you *must* know how to work with spreadsheets at a high level, learn SQL (sometimes pronounced sequel), and know how to create visualizations (Tableau is the most common way to do this). After reading about 100 job descriptions, you should also probably learn Python- but you should start with spreadsheets and SQL and build up from there. Everything else that I talk about in this guide will be optional, and depending on which direction you go in the field some will be more important than others.
